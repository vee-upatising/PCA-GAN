* ## Documentation
  * ## [PCA GAN Training](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vee-upatising/PCA-GAN/blob/main/PCA%20GAN%20Training.ipynb)
    * This script is used to define the DCGAN class, train the Generative Adversarial Network, generate samples, and save the model at every epoch interval.
    * The Generator and Discriminator models were designed to be trained on an 8 GB GPU. If you have a less powerful GPU then decrease the ```conv_filter``` and ```kernel``` parameters accordingly.
    
    * ### User Specified Parameters:
        * ```data_path```: File path pointing to folder containing dataset.
        * ```img_dimensions```: Tuple representing the dimensions of the images inside the dataset.
        * ```model_path```: File path pointing to folder where you want to save to model as well as generated samples.
        * ```interval```: Integer representing how many epochs between saving your model.
        * ```epochs```: Integer representing how many epochs to train the model.
        * ```batch```: Integer representing how many images to train at one time.
        * ```conv_filters```: Integer representing how many convolutional filters are used in each convolutional layer of the Generator and the Discrminator.
        * ```kernel```: Tuple representing the size of the kernels used in the convolutional layers.
        * ```png```: Boolean flag, set to True if the data has PNGs to remove alpha layer from images.
        
     * ### DCGAN Class:
        * ```__init__(self)```: The class is initialized by defining the dimensions of the input vector as well as the output image. The Generator and Discriminator models get initialized using ```build_generator()``` and ```build_discriminator()```.
        * ```build_generator(self)```: Defines Generator model. There are 5 convolutional layers, upsampling from ```8x8x8``` to ```64x64x3```. Gets called when the DCGAN class is initialized.
        * ```build_discriminator(self)```: Defines Discriminator model. There are 5 convolutional layers, downsampling from ```64x64x3``` to ```1``` scalar prediction. Gets called when the DCGAN class is initialized.
        * ```load_data(self)```: Loads data from user specified file path, ```data_path```. Uses PCA to project the image dataset onto a lower dimension as X_Train dataset. Processes image dataset and reshape to 4 dimensions for Y_Train dataset. Gets called in the ```train()``` method.
        * ```train(self, epochs, batch_size, save_interval)```: Trains the Generative Adversarial Network. Each epoch trains the model using the entire dataset split up into chunks defined by ```batch_size```. If epoch is at ```save_interval```, then the method calls ```save_imgs()``` to generate samples and saves the model of the current epoch.
        * ```save_imgs(self, epoch, gen_imgs, y_points)```: Saves the model and generates prediction samples for a given epoch at the user specified path, ```model_path```. Each sample contains 8 generated predictions and 8 training samples.
    
  * ## [PCA GAN Inference](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vee-upatising/PCA-GAN/blob/main/PCA%20GAN%20Inference.ipynb)
    * This script is used to perform inference on Generator models trained by the ```PCA GAN Training``` script and interpolate points in the latent space of the Generator model input.
    * The pretrained model provided, ```model.h5```, can be used with this notebook.
    * The interpolation of points can be used to make GIFs of walking through the latent space of the Generator model input such as the GIF in this README.
    
    * ### User Specified Parameters:
        * ```data_path```: File path pointing to folder containing dataset.
        * ```img_dimensions```: Tuple representing the dimensions of the images inside the dataset.
        * ```model_path```: File path pointing to folder where you want to save to model as well as generated samples.
        * ```save_path```: File path pointing to folder where you want to save generated predictions of the trained model.
        * ```png```: Boolean flag, set to True if the data has PNGs to remove alpha layer from images.
        
  * ## [Model Visualization](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vee-upatising/PCA-GAN/blob/main/Model%20Visualization.ipynb)
    * This script is used to visualize the convolutional filters inside the Generator models trained by the ```PCA GAN Training``` script.
    * The pretrained model provided, ```model.h5```, can be used with this notebook.
    * This script uses the [Keract](https://github.com/philipperemy/keract) library to visualize what is happening at each convolutional filter when performing inference on a model.
    
    * ### User Specified Parameters:
        * ```data_path```: File path pointing to folder containing dataset.
        * ```img_dimensions```: Tuple representing the dimensions of the images inside the dataset.
        * ```model_path```: File path pointing to folder where you want to save to model as well as generated samples.
        * ```png```: Boolean flag, set to True if the data has PNGs to remove alpha layer from images.
